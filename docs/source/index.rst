Uplink üì°
*********
A Declarative HTTP Client for Python. Inspired by `Retrofit
<http://square.github.io/retrofit/>`__.

|Release| |Python Version| |License| |Coverage Status| |Gitter|

.. note::

   Uplink is currently in initial development and, therefore, not
   production ready at the moment. Furthermore, as the package follows a
   `semantic versioning <https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/distributing-packages/#semantic-versioning-preferred>`__
   scheme, the public API outlined in this documentation should be
   considered tentative until the :code:`v1.0.0` release.

   However, while Uplink is under construction, we invite eager users
   to install early and provide open feedback, which can be as simple as
   opening a GitHub issue when you notice a missing feature, latent defect,
   documentation oversight, etc.

   Moreover, for those interested in contributing, checkout the `Contribution
   Guide on GitHub`_!

A Quick Walkthrough, with GitHub API v3:
========================================
Turn a Python class into a self-describing consumer of your favorite HTTP
webservice, using method decorators and function annotations:

.. code-block:: python

    from uplink import *

    # To define common request metadata, you can decorate the class
    # rather than each method separately.
    @headers({"Accept": "application/vnd.github.v3.full+json"})
    class GitHub(Consumer):

        @get("/users/{username}")
        def get_user(self, username):
            """Get a single user."""

        @json
        @patch("/user{?access_token}")
        def update_user(self, access_token, **info: Body):
            """Update an authenticated user."""

Let's instantiate this consumer to access the main GitHub API:

.. code-block:: python

    github = GitHub(base_url="https://api.github.com/")

To access the API with this instance, we can invoke any of the methods
that we defined in our class definition above. To illustrate, let's
update my GitHub profile bio with :py:meth:`update_user`:

.. code-block:: python

    response = github.update_user(token, bio="Beam me up, Scotty!")

*Voila*, the method seamlessly builds the request (using the decorators
and annotations from the method's definition) and executes it in the same call.
And, by default, Uplink uses the powerful `Requests
<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_ library. So, the returned
:py:obj:`response` is simply a :py:class:`requests.Response` (`documentation
<http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/api/#requests.Response>`__):

.. code-block:: python

    print(response.json()) # {u'disk_usage': 216141, u'private_gists': 0, ...

In essence, Uplink delivers reusable and self-sufficient objects for
accessing HTTP webservices, with minimal code and user pain ‚ò∫Ô∏è .

Asynchronous Requests
---------------------
Uplink includes support for concurrent requests with asyncio (for Python 3.4+)
and Twisted (for all supported Python versions). Checkout
:ref:`non-blocking requests` for more.

   The Public API
   ==============

   .. todo::

      Most of this guide is unfinished and completing it is a planned
      deliverable for the ``v0.3.0`` release. At the least, this work will
      necessitate adding docstrings to the classes enumerated below.
